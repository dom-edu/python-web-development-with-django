Example:

Make a travel journal that allows you to upload each of your images from each of your different travels with a text snippet below each. Let's call the app "trips"  

# Make a new project 
```
django-admin startproject travel_project
cd travel_project 
``` 

# Make a new app in travel_project called trips 
```
python manage.py startapp trips
```

# Install Pillow 
```
pip install Pillow
```
